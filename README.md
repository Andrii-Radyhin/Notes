# Notes
Notes for Windows.
This program create by first time the folder (C:/Notes). This folder will be used for "Save" function and/or like offer for "Save as...". If you want to see your files via "Browse", you need to save files in folder that offers you the program (I consider it would be better to manage files when they are in one folder).
"Save as..." offer user to save in any format and directory. "Save" contrariwise do it "secretly": after saving user see only path and "File saved".
